## What’s Included:

### **Part 1: Networking Fundamentals**

- **IP Addressing Basics**: Understanding octets, classes, public vs private IPs
- **Subnetting and CIDR**: Complete guide with calculation formulas, examples, and quick reference tables
- **OSI and TCP/IP Models**: All 7 layers explained with protocols
- **Routing and Protocols**: DNS, DHCP, NAT, routing tables

### **Part 2: Azure-Specific Networking**

- **Azure Virtual Networks**: Address planning, best practices
- **Azure Subnetting**: The critical “5 reserved IPs” rule and dedicated subnets
- **Network Security**: NSGs, ASGs, Azure Firewall, DDoS Protection, Private Link
- **Hybrid Connectivity**: VPN Gateway, ExpressRoute, VNet Peering
- **Load Balancing**: All Azure load balancing options compared

### **Part 3: Learning Resources**

Complete list of official Microsoft documentation, training paths, and tools specifically for:

- Azure Virtual Networks
- IP Address planning
- Network security
- **AZ-700** certification (Azure Network Engineer Associate)

### **Part 4: Practical Exercises**

Hands-on scenarios for:

- Subnet calculations
- VNet design
- NSG rule creation
- Hub-spoke topology design

### **Part 5: Certification Path**

Recommended progression:

1. **AZ-900** (Fundamentals) →
1. **AZ-104** (Administrator) →
1. **AZ-700** (Network Engineer Associate)

## Key Highlights for Your Technical Test:

**Critical Concepts**:

- ✅ Octet significance in IP addresses (192.168.1.100)
- ✅ CIDR notation (/24, /26, etc.) - NOT “clans” 😊
- ✅ Azure reserves **5 IPs per subnet** (this is crucial!)
- ✅ Subnetting calculations and planning
- ✅ Hub-spoke topology (common in enterprise Azure)

**Quick Reference Tables** included for:

- All CIDR blocks (/32 to /8)
- Subnet mask conversions
- Common port numbers
- Azure CLI and PowerShell commands

This guide should give you everything you need for the Team Rockstars technical assessment! The combination of fundamental networking knowledge and Azure-specific implementations will demonstrate comprehensive cloud engineering expertise.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
